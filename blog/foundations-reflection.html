    <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
    <h3 class="date">14.06.22</h3>
      <p>
        <b>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        That I have to have consistency in my lifestyle to be happy and confident.
      </p>
      <p>
        That I have a ways to go before I am confident talking to strangers perhaps in a leadership role or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        That I can learn what seems impossible to me to learn with time and tenacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        They are used for the increasingly collaborative nature of programming. You often need to work as a team so self awareness and emotional intelligence are essential. This being said they’re also essential for your own mental wellbeing so you feel clear and open which lends itself to being more productive at work or learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I was happily surprised a lot of the topics covered here already felt natural to me and were sometimes already in practice. I was also quite surprised at how shy and awkward I was at times talking to others. I hope this is mostly from it being over the internet and it’ll feel a bit more natural in person.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Definitely listening and looping. I just didn’t feel like I had that much to say for 2 minutes and it felt strange talking in that way to a stranger but I got better at it the more I did it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because these topics are all “core” aspects of working in a development team or with a client and greatly improve your mental/physical well-being as well as the well-being of those around you. Programming is a career that is less and less akin to the previous idea of the programmer being someone locked away in isolation without daylight until they produce the final code. It’s collaborative!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not at all! It was all helpful to learn about or a good refresher for things I’d learnt about previously. Programming will of course get its due attention with how hard it is but these core skills are more easily ignored.
