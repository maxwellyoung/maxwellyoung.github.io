    <h1>Learning plan</h1>
    <h3 class="date">21.06.22</h3>
    <h2>Sprint 5</h2>
      <p>
        <b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d like to make meaningful and beautiful things on the web with other special people but frankly primarily to be making a living from doing work to do with these skills sooner than later.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest weaknesses I’m feeling the most I have this week as multiple personal things have come up and distracted me. I have a lot to learn in time organisation, sleep schedules, and consistency. These sorts of things are almost discouraged in the creative process (at least my own) but I know my night bursts of doing the work alongside bouts of procrastination will be detrimental if they continue in this type of work. A strength of mine might be tenacity or some kind of bigger belief in trusting the process, a growth mindset if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine weeks, etc.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping focused for nine weeks will be daunting as I haven’t been to school since 2019 and have only worked strange little side jobs that didn’t require much concentration. Also getting there on time because I’m a night owl and maybe getting over some social anxiety/awkwardness. One more thing would that I’m worried about letting people down, and not carrying my weight but I know that everyone brings something different to the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>For example, this could be communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self-awareness and reflective skills.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Would be very cool to develop some leadership skills as that idea is quite daunting at the moment. This whole social dynamic will be quite new to me. It usually takes me a while to warm up to people or maybe better put, understand where they’re coming from so I know how to talk to them or help us be on the same page, until I reach that stage I can be shy or possibly off-putting I worry!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is helpful to voice these expectations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Consistent communication and active listening. My biggest pet peeve is when people don’t listen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When in the space physically dedicated to the course I think my concentration will be helped and I’ll be more inspired to overcome the challenges and be part of the social environment. Sleeping earlier will be a big change for me! Basing a new routine around that with exercise, meditating and eating three meals a day will become more of a necessity and a joy than a chore. Talking to others I will be polite, attentive and wanting everyone to use their strengths.
      </p>
    <h2>Sprint 2</h2>
    <p>
      It is my goal to work in web development in some capacity in order to support myself and work on meaningful, beautiful projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m very passionate and driven when I see my purpose clearly, whether this purpose is given to me directly or is a stroke of creativity. When I don’t feel a clear sense of either of these purposes I lose interest and motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time at Dev Academy I hope to become more confident in collaborating with others. Not that it’s a serious issue, just something I hope to see improve in myself. Also time management and organisation. These have always been difficult for me but not pressing issues as a musician so I’m expecting managing workload and timing to be quite a challenge once bootcamp begins.</p>
    <p>To keep on top of things I will continue to have a good routine of sleep and mindfulness to keep me balanced and focused for taking in lots of information. I’ll continue to use the pomodoro timer for balance and consistency. I’ll be active in the discord community being sure not to miss too much. I believe the more I’ll learn in this course the more I’ll want to learn as I feel more encouraged feeling the nodes in my brain connecting, like Alice falling down the rabbit hole. Communicating with others I hope to be seen as polite and interested despite being a younger student, willing to learn over anything else like ego or pride.</p>
    <p>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
    <p>I’ll seek help when I feel my lack of understanding might not even be enough to adequately go</p>
    <p>All I’d ask of the facilitation team is to be there happy to answer questions or concerns whether with the material, personally or with others. I’d hope that they’d keep a steady line of communication with al the students so no one falls behind or out of the flow just because they’re too shy to share.</p> 
    <p>My other commitments come after Dev Academy during my study here. Music may need recording sometimes or something but that’d only be a rarity if at all and would only happen after my weeks work was completed.</p>
