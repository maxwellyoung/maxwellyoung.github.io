    <h1>Learning plan</h1>
    <h3 class="date">21.06.22</h3>
    <p>It is my goal to work in web development in some capacity in order to support myself and work on meaningful, beautiful projects.</p>
    <p>I’m very passionate and driven when I see my purpose clearly, whether this purpose is given to me directly or is a stroke of creativity. When I don’t feel a clear sense of either of these purposes I lose interest and motivation.</p>
    <p>During my time at Dev Academy I hope to become more confident in collaborating with others. Not that it’s a serious issue, just something I hope to see improve in myself. Also time management and organisation. These have always been difficult for me but not pressing issues as a musician so I’m expecting managing workload and timing to be quite a challenge once bootcamp begins.</p>
    <p>To keep on top of things I will continue to have a good routine of sleep and mindfulness to keep me balanced and focused for taking in lots of information. I’ll continue to use the pomodoro timer for balance and consistency. I’ll be active in the discord community being sure not to miss too much. I believe the more I’ll learn in this course the more I’ll want to learn as I feel more encouraged feeling the nodes in my brain connecting, like Alice falling down the rabbit hole. Communicating with others I hope to be seen as polite and interested despite being a younger student, willing to learn over anything else like ego or pride.</p>
    <p>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
    <p>I’ll seek help when I feel my lack of understanding might not even be enough to adequately go</p>
    <p>All I’d ask of the facilitation team is to be there happy to answer questions or concerns whether with the material, personally or with others. I’d hope that they’d keep a steady line of communication with al the students so no one falls behind or out of the flow just because they’re too shy to share.</p> 
    <p>My other commitments come after Dev Academy during my study here. Music may need recording sometimes or something but that’d only be a rarity if at all and would only happen after my weeks work was completed.</p>
