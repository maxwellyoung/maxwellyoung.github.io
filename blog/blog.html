          Research Neuroplasticity
        </h2>
        <p>
          <b>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</b>
        </p>
        <p>People used to believe once your brain had developed into an adult brain it was fixed in place. But this isn’t true, it’s constantly adapting and changing to new information with the engagement of learning processes. Every time we think, feel or do pathways in our brain light up. The pathways of things that have become habitual for us will be more ingrained and less difficult. People are encouraged to try new things knowing that we can rewire our brains to get over bad habits and learn new processes through carving new pathways. I wish I was aware the brain worked like this in high school as I imagine it would’ve made me less discouraged comparing myself to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have the sense I can physically feel when my brain is lacking stimulation similarly to how I feel when my body is lacking in physical exertion. This lack is determined as depression (different to the psychiatric disorder, rather the deflation of cell response) while this mental exertion is called potentiation. Having learnt skills that were seemingly impossible to me before or felt divergent from who I am I now understand that anything can be learnt within the right personal context. Topics that are off-putting like mathematics which always felt uncreative to me can be recontextualised through imagining and by being a means to a creative end. Mathematics is a good example of a topic for Neuroplasticity. The practice of mathematics is entirely imaginary and can be thought of as a trek into an unknown forest. We are intimidated by the forest but clear foliage to make our pathways. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Repetition of certain mental processes or tasks. A mathematician isn’t necessarily much smarter than a non-mathematician they’re simply more structurally aware and have done problem-solving for a longer time so they’re more doubtful. Whatever pathway you want to improve improvement will also inevitably happen with repetition!

        <p>
          As I’m finding the process of problem-solving in regards to programming a daunting new mental challenge I’ve been finding the book Measurement by Paul Lockhart comforting and explanatory of these mental processes.

          <b>Research Growth Mindset</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <b>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is the belief that our talents can be developed through doing the Mahi, getting help from others around us and considering strategies. Studies show that people that follow this belief achieve a higher ability than those with fixed mindsets, people who people they were born with certain abilities and lack other abilities. When people have this growth mindset people are more eager to embark on the task at hand no matter how challenging. It makes them part of a team working towards a collective goal rather than an isolated person with a list of abilities that can be contributed when required. A growth mindset also would lead you to compare yourself less and avoid a demeaning attitude towards yourself or others.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you’re stuck with a growth mindset instead of feeling brutally discouraged, maybe to the point of wanting to give up, you feel encouraged to try new approaches or reach out for help. A fixed mindset wrongly makes you think of these as a last resort or failures while they will often lead you to learn more than you would otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          It helped me realise the importance of recognising progress! It’s an essential part of learning or working and shouldn’t go unrecognised. On the other side of the coin, I think the benefit of this mode of learning gives you more confidence the more you achieve with it. Once you’ve learnt one skill that felt completely foreign to you you are more open to giving new things a go. The more you solve programming problems the more belief you have that you are growing in your understanding of the skill so you are more likely to embark on the next one with confidence and less likely for moments of getting stuck to halt your progress. It goes beyond saying you appreciate values of growth etc. consistent action aligning with growth mindset thinking must be made and maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll try to think of times I surpassed my perceived limit of myself when I am stuck and teetering on feeling programming/problem solving is beyond my ability. I have a lot of anxiety about this right now but knowledge of a growth mindset is making me more eager than fearful (I think!)

        <p>
          Understanding more about how the brain develops in a malleable way gives me more confidence to get help from others, try new processes and not get so discouraged I give up. Our brains are more malleable than we might tend to think just as problem-solving is.

        <h1><a href="/blog/javascript-dom.html">Javascript, DOM</a></h1>
        <h3 class="date">01.06.22</h3>
        <p>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS. 
        </p><p>The construction of a website can be thought of in similar terms to the construction of a liveable house. The first step to build a house (after the design stage is done) is hire people to construct the entire frame of the structure walls, the floors. This is the foundation of the house. The language of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is to create what this is for a website. A website has something similar to rooms in a page having different sections with different purposes like how rooms have different purposes. This hierarchy isn’t only visual when implemented correctly in HTML. The addition of semantic HTML allows for visually impaired people who use screen readers to navigate to where they need to get on a website much easier. Once a houses framework is created it needs interior design and decoration. Paint on the walls, flooring, lighting. The decoration of a website is handled via the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) language.
        </p><p>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.      
        </p><p>Control flow is the process in which the machine runs the lines of code, from top to bottom, storing functions repeating loops, conditionals which determine the flow and loops which repeat sections of code. Loops allow for the automation of processes. It could be thought of like the road directions to a place but if you had to loop around certain places.      
        </p><p>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.    
        </p><p> document object model is a tree of web elements. The tree of a website gets very complex as it covers every part that makes up the site. It allows for you to treat HTML/CSS elements similarly to the way you would Javascript objects.    
        </p><p>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.    
        </p><p>To put it simply you use arrays instead of objects when the data you are storing should be in order. The rest of the time you can use objects. Arrays are usually data structures of numbers. Numbers inside an array would become the elements of that array. Objects are better suited for text elements.  One reason to use arrays for data rather than objects is for their length property. Arrays are objects but only in javascript. The definitive part of arrays is that they store the data in an ordered list so to access arrays elements you use their numerical index. To delete elements from arrays you use the pop() function while you’d use the delete keyword for deleting object properties.    
        </p><p>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.    
        </p><p>Functions are helpful because not dissimilar to a recipe, they store simple or complex processes under one name that can be reused. They can be as short or as long as the programmer requires.

        <h1><a href="/blog/emotional-intelligence.html">Emotional Intelligence</a></h1>
        <h3 class="date">30.05.22</h3>
        <p>What is emotional intelligence? 
        </p><p>Ones natural ability to read the sentiments of themselves and those around them to different situations or scenarios and their instinct of what would help in that state. Empathy for someone else's perspective with all their different experiences and points of view a core part of being emotionally intelligent. It allows us to maintain a certain level of tolerance and bring another level of comprehension to life events with turbulent emotional factors. There is a level of balance to ones well being that emotional intelligence brings. It reaches the emotional subtext of a person, acknowledging people's actions aren’t made in a vacuum but are rather, accustomed to patterns, misinterpreted, possibly entirely unexplainable to you at present but profoundly understandable later.
        </p><p>How is it different to IQ?      
        </p><p>The first difference that comes to my mind is that it’s not measured to the extent IQ is or can be. While they are both levels of ability the similarities don’t go much further. IQ is the defined metric of someone's intellect. One could be very successful in their understanding of complex systems or execution of difficult tasks etc but lack key emotional comprehension. Often IQ comes at the expense of other human qualities whether out of ego or neglect. This is being tolerated less and less by groups whether employers or audiences, therefore emotional intelligence should be recognised and worked at as much if not more than IQ.      
        </p><p>Why is it important?    
        </p><p>It’s important for a plethora of reasons. Perhaps the foremost reason is for your own wellbeing. The balanced approach creates a fortitude in the self. This balanced approach is also helpful in our relationships. Workplaces can be very stressful and often people from a wide variety of backgrounds have different approaches. For me acknowledging the natural ebb and flow of my emotions has always centred me somewhat. Knowing for every down there is an equal up and vice versa. Being less precious about when things go wrong helps us to not feel so crushed as to act out drastically and immaturely.

        <h1><a href="/blog/html-css.html">What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</a></h1>
      <h3 class="date">18.04.22</h3>
        <p>Positioning is a key part of CSS web design.</p> 
        <p>It allows you to change the behaviour of different elements on the page whether text, an image, card etc.</p> 
        <p>There are in total 5 position types. These are "static", "absolute", "relative", "fixed" & "sticky".</p>
        <p><b>Static</b> is the default or normal position type. It'll keep elements following the normal flow of the site.</p>
        <p><i>position: static;</i></p>
        <p><b>Absolute</b> can be a useful positioning type for specific placement of things like positioning is probably the strangest of the position types.</p>
        <p><i>position: absolute;</i></p>
        <p><b>Relative</b> positioning is probably the strangest of the position types.</p>
        <p>Without other positioning declarations the element will be treated no different to a static. However when say a bottom: 10px is applied, the bottom it’ll be positioned from will be from the point the element would be without positioning declarations.</p>
        <p>Relative will maintain the normal flow of the document. The website CSS-Tricks puts its as “relative to itself”. If you need to define an elements “z-index” and want to remove it from the document flow, use position: absolute. If you need to define an elements “z-index” and want to maintain the document flow, use position: relative.</p>
        <p><i>position: relative;</i>
        <p><b>Fixed</b> positioning works how you might imagine from the title. The viewport serves as the basis for the positioning of a fixed elements. Because the viewport remains the viewport no matter where the user has scrolled or navigated to, fixed elements remain in tthe same defined space, frozen in time & space.. For example the navigation bar on this blog remains at the same position and is constantly visible even when you scroll down to view more blog posts.</p>
        <p><i>position: fixed;</i></p>
        <p><b>Sticky</b> is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element sticky positioning is applied to is treated as relative up until it crosses a defined threshold at which point the element becomes fixed, maybe until another threshold is reached. You could think of it as the stacking position. For instance on this blog, the date to the right of the screen is using sticky positioning to keep the date in the same place as you scroll through the blog post until the threshold of the next blog post is reached and the date of that post follows the same behaviour as the previous date.</p>
        <p><i>position: sticky;</i></p>

    <h1><a href="/blog/learning-plan.html">Learning plan</a></h1>
    <h3 class="date">21.06.22</h3>
      <p>It is my goal to work in web development in some capacity in order to support myself and work on meaningful, beautiful projects.</p>
      <p>I’m very passionate and driven when I see my purpose clearly, whether this purpose is given to me directly or is a stroke of creativity. When I don’t feel a clear sense of either of these purposes I lose interest and motivation.</p>
      <p>During my time at Dev Academy I hope to become more confident in collaborating with others. Not that it’s a serious issue, just something I hope to see improve in myself. Also time management and organisation. These have always been difficult for me but not pressing issues as a musician so I’m expecting managing workload and timing to be quite a challenge once bootcamp begins.</p>
      <p>To keep on top of things I will continue to have a good routine of sleep and mindfulness to keep me balanced and focused for taking in lots of information. I’ll continue to use the pomodoro timer for balance and consistency. I’ll be active in the discord community being sure not to miss too much. I believe the more I’ll learn in this course the more I’ll want to learn as I feel more encouraged feeling the nodes in my brain connecting, like Alice falling down the rabbit hole. Communicating with others I hope to be seen as polite and interested despite being a younger student, willing to learn over anything else like ego or pride.</p>
      <p>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
      <p>I’ll seek help when I feel my lack of understanding might not even be enough to adequately go</p>
      <p>All I’d ask of the facilitation team is to be there happy to answer questions or concerns whether with the material, personally or with others. I’d hope that they’d keep a steady line of communication with al the students so no one falls behind or out of the flow just because they’re too shy to share.</p> 
      <p>My other commitments come after Dev Academy during my study here. Music may need recording sometimes or something but that’d only be a rarity if at all and would only happen after my weeks work was completed.</p>

    <h1><a href="/blog/identity-values.html">My identity</a></h1>
    <h3 class="date">22.05.22</h3>
      <p>My name is Maxwell Young. I’m a musician and budding developer from Poneke, Aotearoa. Through working in pop music I’ve gained experience collaborating on projects where ego can get involved but just like when working on technology the end goal is a product that is designed to be used by people on a large scale. When studying music for a year at Massey University I found it very difficult to work as a group. We had different skill levels and confidence. I felt like nobody else was contributing and often stepped up to become the de facto leader so we could finish the assignments. While feeling some self-importance in doing this I failed to acknowledge how I was an intimidating figure to the others as I’d already had some success in music and really should’ve spent more time helping them share their ideas. Of course I had so much yet to learn I didn't have the first idea of, even if just in lessons of collaboration. It grew tense and there were some bad moments. Collaborating in music since that year at Massey has been very informative and different. I’ve learnt it’s much easier to collaborate when you have mutual respect as a group, you allow for a space where there are no silly ideas and each idea is given its due. The focus has to be on the end product though and its success as something usable or worthwhile in the world. Doing the Myers Briggs test again was interesting as I haven’t done a personality test in a while. I’ve found they do vary very every couple of years. I am proud to see open-mindedness, creativity and passion in my strengths and recognise those as traits I can’t help bring to whatever given project or social situation is at hand. Regarding the weaknesses self-isolating immediately jumps out at me. I definitely do this and get into a loop of unfocused, unrealistic self-criticism. To get avoid this sort of thing happening I’ve found exercise and putting the effort into communicating to help me. Communication with a peer or really whoever can help me be more realistic and focus on what’s important, which helps me feel I have a purpose. To be frank I think most of my negative traits stem from a feeling of purposelessness. As someone who is naturally creative, I tend to find I naturally work in bursts more than consistently. This is something I’m constantly grappling with and understand how negative it can be in a group environment. Honesty and open-mindedness are also really important to me.</p>
      <p>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</p>
      <p>An example of the types of ethical decisions I have to make in music sometimes is the split of credit and revenue. For a song I made with 2 friends one night where we couldn’t remember how much each of us contributed to the song, I decided the best thing would be to split the revenue equally as really in creative collaboration just saying something or the unrelated conversation had before making the product all contribute to the final result.</p>
      <p>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
      <p>The culture I’d honestly most align myself with would be in the arts and in music as it’s been a core part of my life since beginning to play violin at 3 through being in orchestra’s and especially since I began to garner an audience and music peers at 16. I believe it makes me sometimes a perfectionist or overly critical of myself and what I do to often a negative degree. It also encourages a vague “artistic sensibility” which can be unfocused overly blue sky thinking. I rely on my musical partner to be the pragmatic one. But through these negatives arises pure joy and satisfaction when things seemingly impossible or simply nonexistent have come into being through all the time the contributors have spent in their crafts as well as the beauty of their collaboration working together for a greater good.</p>
