      <h1>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h1>
      <h3 class="date">18.04.22</h3>
      <p>Positioning is a key part of CSS web design. <br><br> It allows you to change the behaviour of different elements on the page whether text, an image, card etc.<br> There are in total 5 position types. These are "static", "absolute", "relative", "fixed" & "sticky".
        <br><br><b>Static</b> is the default or normal position type.   It'll keep elements following the normal flow of the site.<br><br><i>position: static;</i>
         
         <br><br><b>Absolute</b> can be a useful positioning type for specific placement of things like positioning is probably the strangest of the position types.
        
         <br><br><i>position: absolute;</i>
         <br><br>
        <b>Relative</b> Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Labore, nihil iure! Quidem voluptatum error ex quae hic nulla provident deleniti expedita minima optio? Eveniet perspiciatis vitae at velit nulla laudantium.
        <br><br>
        <i>position: relative;</i>
        
        
        <br><br>
        <b>Fixed</b> positioning works how you might imagine from the title. The viewport serves as the basis for the positioning of a fixed elements. Because the viewport remains the viewport no matter where the user has scrolled or navigated to, fixed elements remain in tthe same defined space, frozen in time & space.. For example the navigation bar on this blog remains at the same position and is constantly visible even when you scroll down to view more blog posts.
        <br><br>
        <i>position: fixed;</i>
        <br><br><b>Sticky</b> is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element sticky positioning is applied to is treated as relative up until it crosses a defined threshold at which point the element becomes fixed, maybe until another threshold is reached. You could think of it as the stacking position. For instance on this blog, the date to the right of the screen is using sticky positioning to keep the date in the same place as you scroll through the blog post until the threshold of the next blog post is reached and the date of that post follows the same behaviour as the previous date.

    <h1>My identity</h1>
    <h3 class="date">22.05.22</h3>
    <p>My name is Maxwell Young. I’m a musician and budding developer from Poneke, Aotearoa. Through working in pop music I’ve gained experience collaborating on projects where ego can get involved but just like when working on technology the end goal is a product that is designed to be used by people at a large scale. 

      When studying music for a year at Massey University I found it very difficult to work as a group. We had different skill levels and confidence. I felt like nobody else was contributing and often stepped up to become the de facto leader so we could finish the assignments. While feeling some self importance in doing this I failed to acknowledge how I was an intimidating figure to the others as I’d already had some success in music and really should’ve spent more time helping them share their ideas. Of course I had so much yet to learn I didn't have the first idea of, even if just in lessons of collaboration. It grew tense and there were some bad moments. Collaborating in music since that year at Massey has been very informative and different. I’ve learnt it’s much easier to collaborate when you have mutual respect as a group, you allow for a space where there’s no silly ideas and each idea is given its due. The focus has to be on the end product though and its success as something usable or worthwhile in the world.
      
      Doing the Myers Briggs test again was interesting as I haven’t done a personality test in a while. I’ve found they do vary very every couple years. I am proud to see open-mindedness, creative and passion in my strengths and definitely recognise those as traits I can’t help bring to whatever given project or social situation is at hand.  Regarding the weaknesses self isolating immediately jumps out at me. I definitely do this and get into a loop of unfocused, unrealistic self criticism. To get avoid this sort of thing happening I’ve found exercise and putting the effort in to communicate to help me. Communication with a peer or really whoever can help me be more realistic and focus on what’s important, which helps me feel I have purpose. To be frank I think most of my negative traits stem from a feeling of purposelessness. 
      
      As someone who is naturally creative I tend to find I naturally work in bursts more than consistently. This is something I’m constantly grappling with and understand how negative it can be in a group environment. Honesty and open mindedness are also really important to me.
