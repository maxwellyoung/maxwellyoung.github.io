          <b>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</b>
        </p>
        <p>People used to believe once your brain had developed into an adult brain it was fixed in place. But this isn’t true, it’s constantly adapting and changing to new information with the engagement of learning processes. Every time we think, feel or do pathways in our brain light up. The pathways of things that have become habitual for us will be more ingrained and less difficult. People are encouraged to try new things knowing that we can rewire our brains to get over bad habits and learn new processes through carving new pathways. I wish I was aware the brain worked like this in high school as I imagine it would’ve made me less discouraged comparing myself to others.

          <b>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have the sense I can physically feel when my brain is lacking stimulation similarly to how I feel when my body is lacking in physical exertion. This lack is determined as depression (different to the psychiatric disorder, rather the deflation of cell response) while this mental exertion is called potentiation. Having learnt skills that were seemingly impossible to me before or felt divergent from who I am I now understand that anything can be learnt within the right personal context. Topics that are off-putting like mathematics which always felt uncreative to me can be recontextualised through imagining and by being a means to a creative end. Mathematics is a good example of a topic for Neuroplasticity. The practice of mathematics is entirely imaginary and can be thought of as a trek into an unknown forest. We are intimidated by the forest but clear foliage to make our pathways.

          <b>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Repetition of certain mental processes or tasks. A mathematician isn’t necessarily much smarter than a non-mathematician they’re simply more structurally aware and have done problem-solving for a longer time so they’re more doubtful. Whatever pathway you want to improve improvement will also inevitably happen with repetition!

          As I’m finding the process of problem-solving in regards to programming a daunting new mental challenge I’ve been finding the book Measurement by Paul Lockhart comforting and explanatory of these mental processes.

          <b>Research Growth Mindset</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <b>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is the belief that our talents can be developed through doing the Mahi, getting help from others around us and considering strategies. Studies show that people that follow this belief achieve a higher ability than those with fixed mindsets, people who people they were born with certain abilities and lack other abilities. When people have this growth mindset people are more eager to embark on the task at hand no matter how challenging. It makes them part of a team working towards a collective goal rather than an isolated person with a list of abilities that can be contributed when required. A growth mindset also would lead you to compare yourself less and avoid a demeaning attitude towards yourself or others.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you’re stuck with a growth mindset instead of feeling brutally discouraged, maybe to the point of wanting to give up, you feel encouraged to try new approaches or reach out for help. A fixed mindset wrongly makes you think of these as a last resort or failures while they will often lead you to learn more than you would otherwise.

          <b>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</b>
        </p>

          It helped me realise the importance of recognising progress! It’s an essential part of learning or working and shouldn’t go unrecognised. On the other side of the coin, I think the benefit of this mode of learning gives you more confidence the more you achieve with it. Once you’ve learnt one skill that felt completely foreign to you you are more open to giving new things a go. The more you solve programming problems the more belief you have that you are growing in your understanding of the skill so you are more likely to embark on the next one with confidence and less likely for moments of getting stuck to halt your progress. It goes beyond saying you appreciate values of growth etc. consistent action aligning with growth mindset thinking must be made and maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll try to think of times I surpassed my perceived limit of myself when I am stuck and teetering on feeling programming/problem solving is beyond my ability. I have a lot of anxiety about this right now but knowledge of a growth mindset is making me more eager than fearful (I think!)

          <b>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</b>

          Understanding more about how the brain develops in a malleable way gives me more confidence to get help from others, try new processes and not get so discouraged I give up. Our brains are more malleable than we might tend to think just as problem-solving is.
