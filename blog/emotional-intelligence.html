        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <h3 class="date">30.05.22</h3>
        <p>What is emotional intelligence? 
          <br><br>Ones natural ability to read the sentiments of themselves and those around them to different situations or scenarios and their instinct of what would help in that state. Empathy for someone else's perspective with all their different experiences and points of view a core part of being emotionally intelligent. It allows us to maintain a certain level of tolerance and bring another level of comprehension to life events with turbulent emotional factors. There is a level of balance to ones well being that emotional intelligence brings. It reaches the emotional subtext of a person, acknowledging people's actions aren’t made in a vacuum but are rather, accustomed to patterns, misinterpreted, possibly entirely unexplainable to you at present but profoundly understandable later.
          <br><br>How is it different to IQ?      
          <br><br>The first difference that comes to my mind is that it’s not measured to the extent IQ is or can be. While they are both levels of ability the similarities don’t go much further. IQ is the defined metric of someone's intellect. One could be very successful in their understanding of complex systems or execution of difficult tasks etc but lack key emotional comprehension. Often IQ comes at the expense of other human qualities whether out of ego or neglect. This is being tolerated less and less by groups whether employers or audiences, therefore emotional intelligence should be recognised and worked at as much if not more than IQ.      
          <br><br>Why is it important?    
          <br><br>It’s important for a plethora of reasons. Perhaps the foremost reason is for your own wellbeing. The balanced approach creates a fortitude in the self. This balanced approach is also helpful in our relationships. Workplaces can be very stressful and often people from a wide variety of backgrounds have different approaches. For me acknowledging the natural ebb and flow of my emotions has always centred me somewhat. Knowing for every down there is an equal up and vice versa. Being less precious about when things go wrong helps us to not feel so crushed as to act out drastically and immaturely.
