        <h1>JavaScript, DOM</h1>
        <h3 class="date">01.06.22</h3>
        <p>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS. 
          <br><br>The construction of a website can be thought of in similar terms to the construction of a liveable house. The first step to build a house (after the design stage is done) is hire people to construct the entire frame of the structure walls, the floors. This is the foundation of the house. The language of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is to create what this is for a website. A website has something similar to rooms in a page having different sections with different purposes like how rooms have different purposes. This hierarchy isn’t only visual when implemented correctly in HTML. The addition of semantic HTML allows for visually impaired people who use screen readers to navigate to where they need to get on a website much easier. Once a houses framework is created it needs interior design and decoration. Paint on the walls, flooring, lighting. The decoration of a website is handled via the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) language.
          <br><br>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.      
          <br><br>Control flow is the process in which the machine runs the lines of code, from top to bottom, storing functions repeating loops, conditionals which determine the flow and loops which repeat sections of code. Loops allow for the automation of processes. It could be thought of like the road directions to a place but if you had to loop around certain places.      
          <br><br>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.    
          <br><br>The document object model is a tree of web elements. The tree of a website gets very complex as it covers every part that makes up the site. It allows for you to treat HTML/CSS elements similarly to the way you would Javascript objects.    
          <br><br>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.    
          <br><br>To put it simply you use arrays instead of objects when the data you are storing should be in order. The rest of the time you can use objects. Arrays are usually data structures of numbers. Numbers inside an array would become the elements of that array. Objects are better suited for text elements.  One reason to use arrays for data rather than objects is for their length property. Arrays are objects but only in javascript. The definitive part of arrays is that they store the data in an ordered list so to access arrays elements you use their numerical index. To delete elements from arrays you use the pop() function while you’d use the delete keyword for deleting object properties.    
          <br><br>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.    
          <br><br>Functions are helpful because not dissimilar to a recipe, they store simple or complex processes under one name that can be reused. They can be as short or as long as the programmer requires.
