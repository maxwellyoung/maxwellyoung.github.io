    <h1>My identity</h1>
    <h3 class="date">22.05.22</h3>
      <p>My name is Maxwell Young. I’m a musician and budding developer from Poneke, Aotearoa. Through working in pop music I’ve gained experience collaborating on projects where ego can get involved but just like when working on technology the end goal is a product that is designed to be used by people on a large scale. When studying music for a year at Massey University I found it very difficult to work as a group. We had different skill levels and confidence. I felt like nobody else was contributing and often stepped up to become the de facto leader so we could finish the assignments. While feeling some self-importance in doing this I failed to acknowledge how I was an intimidating figure to the others as I’d already had some success in music and really should’ve spent more time helping them share their ideas. Of course I had so much yet to learn I didn't have the first idea of, even if just in lessons of collaboration. It grew tense and there were some bad moments. Collaborating in music since that year at Massey has been very informative and different. I’ve learnt it’s much easier to collaborate when you have mutual respect as a group, you allow for a space where there are no silly ideas and each idea is given its due. The focus has to be on the end product though and its success as something usable or worthwhile in the world. Doing the Myers Briggs test again was interesting as I haven’t done a personality test in a while. I’ve found they do vary very every couple of years. I am proud to see open-mindedness, creativity and passion in my strengths and recognise those as traits I can’t help bring to whatever given project or social situation is at hand. Regarding the weaknesses self-isolating immediately jumps out at me. I definitely do this and get into a loop of unfocused, unrealistic self-criticism. To get avoid this sort of thing happening I’ve found exercise and putting the effort into communicating to help me. Communication with a peer or really whoever can help me be more realistic and focus on what’s important, which helps me feel I have a purpose. To be frank I think most of my negative traits stem from a feeling of purposelessness. As someone who is naturally creative, I tend to find I naturally work in bursts more than consistently. This is something I’m constantly grappling with and understand how negative it can be in a group environment. Honesty and open-mindedness are also really important to me.</p>
      <p>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</p>
      <p>An example of the types of ethical decisions I have to make in music sometimes is the split of credit and revenue. For a song I made with 2 friends one night where we couldn’t remember how much each of us contributed to the song, I decided the best thing would be to split the revenue equally as really in creative collaboration just saying something or the unrelated conversation had before making the product all contribute to the final result.</p>
      <p>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
      <p>The culture I’d honestly most align myself with would be in the arts and in music as it’s been a core part of my life since beginning to play violin at 3 through being in orchestra’s and especially since I began to garner an audience and music peers at 16. I believe it makes me sometimes a perfectionist or overly critical of myself and what I do to often a negative degree. It also encourages a vague “artistic sensibility” which can be unfocused overly blue sky thinking. I rely on my musical partner to be the pragmatic one. But through these negatives arises pure joy and satisfaction when things seemingly impossible or simply nonexistent have come into being through all the time the contributors have spent in their crafts as well as the beauty of their collaboration working together for a greater good.</p>
